# Film-Revenue

## Goal of the project
The primary goal of this project is to develop a reliable machine learning model that can predict film revenues accurately. By analyzing a wide range of film-related features and historical data, our aim is to provide valuable insights to filmmakers, studios, and investors. We want to empower decision-makers in the film industry with a tool that helps them make data-driven choices, ultimately enhancing their chances of financial success in the highly competitive world of cinema.
