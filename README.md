# Film-Revenue

## Goal of the project
The primary goal of this project is to develop a reliable machine learning model that can predict film revenues accurately. By analyzing a wide range of film-related features and historical data, we aim to provide valuable insights to filmmakers, studios, and investors. We want to empower decision-makers in the film industry with a tool that helps them make data-driven choices, ultimately enhancing their chances of financial success in the highly competitive world of cinema.



## Datasets Used
The datasets used include:
- __movies_metadata.csv__: This csv file dataset is a dataset of 45000 movies taken from the kaggle.com - [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)
- __movies.csv__: This a subset of the original dataset, which is usable for the project that has film revenues.
- __cleaned.csv__: This is the processed dataset that is used to train the model. 


## Tools and Technologies used
The tools used in this project include:
- __Python__ - This was needed to conduct <b>Data Quality Assessment</b> and also for <b>Data Cleaning processes</b>. With Python libraries <b>pandas, matplotlib, seaborn</b> exploratory data analysis of the datasets and to gain useful insights from the data was possible.
-  __Scikit and Xgboost__- these libraries were used for importing different models.

## Built With
- Python 3.8.2
